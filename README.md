# 🌸 Eduarda Victoria (Wahi)

Hi! I'm **Eduarda Victoria**, but you can call me **Wahi**.  
I'm a **self-taught programmer** passionate about learning, creating, and exploring different technologies.

Currently, I'm focusing on **Python**, but I'm also interested in expanding to other languages like **C++** and beyond.  
My goal is to understand how things work deeply — not just to make things run, but to make them *make sense*.

Curious mind, creative soul. I like mixing logic and art — whether through code, stories, or design.
